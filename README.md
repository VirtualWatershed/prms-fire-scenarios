# prms-fire-scenarios

In keeping with our aim of serving specific hydrologists' needs while building or demonstrating core
cyberinfrastructure (CI), this tool uses Virtual Watershed technology to provide a tool for
hydrologists wanting to investigate the effects of fire on the outputs of PRMS models.

# Prototype Goals and Milestones (as of 2/25)

There are [two current milestones](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/prms-fire-scenarios/milestones):

1. [Minimum Viable Product due March 25](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/prms-fire-scenarios/milestones/Minimum%20Viable%20Product%20--%20MVP)
1. [v1.0 Release due May 13](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/prms-fire-scenarios/milestones/v1.0%20Release)

The [issues](https://github.com/VirtualWatershed/prms-fire-scenarios/issues) show what needs to be done. There 
are currently only issues for the first milestone, which will be the case for a while. These issues reference 
how to build out the wireframe demo (forthcoming).
