	Abstract = {Scenarios are possible future states of the world that represent alternative plausible conditions under different assumptions. Often, scenarios are developed in a context relevant to stakeholders involved in their applications since the evaluation of scenario outcomes and implications can enhance decision-making activities. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of scenario development and proposes a formal approach to scenario development in environmental decision-making. The discussion of current issues in scenario studies includes advantages and obstacles in utilizing a formal scenario development framework, and the different forms of uncertainty inherent in scenario development, as well as how they should be treated. An appendix for common scenario terminology has been attached for clarity. Major recommendations for future research in this area include proper consideration of uncertainty in scenario studies in particular in relation to stakeholder relevant information, construction of scenarios that are more diverse in nature, and sharing of information and resources among the scenario development research community. },

@article{Feng2011458,
	Abstract = {Great interest currently exists for developing ecosystem models to forecast how ecosystem services may change under alternative land use and climate futures. Ecosystem services are diverse and include supporting services or functions (e.g., primary production, nutrient cycling), provisioning services (e.g., wildlife, groundwater), regulating services (e.g., water purification, floodwater retention), and even cultural services (e.g., ecotourism, cultural heritage). Hence, the knowledge base necessary to quantify ecosystem services is broad and derived from many diverse scientific disciplines. Building the required interdisciplinary models is especially challenging as modelers from different locations and times may develop the disciplinary models needed for ecosystem simulations, and these models must be identified and made accessible to the interdisciplinary simulation. Additional difficulties include inconsistent data structures, formats, and metadata required by geospatial models as well as limitations on computing, storage, and connectivity. Traditional standalone and closed network systems cannot fully support sharing and integrating interdisciplinary geospatial models from variant sources. To address this need, we developed an approach to openly share and access geospatial computational models using distributed Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and open geospatial standards. We included a means to share computational models compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Processing Services (WPS) standard to ensure modelers have an efficient and simplified means to publish new models. To demonstrate our approach, we developed five disciplinary models that can be integrated and shared to simulate a few of the ecosystem services (e.g., water storage, waterfowl breeding) that are provided by wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America. },

@article{Metcalf20101282,
	Abstract = {Complex ecosystems, such as the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), present major management challenges. Such systems often provide a range of ecosystem services that are differentially valued by stakeholders representing distinct interests (e.g., agriculture, conservation, navigation) or institutions (e.g., federal and state agencies). When no single entity has the knowledge or authority to resolve conflicts over shared resource use, stakeholders may struggle to jointly understand the scope of the problem and to reach reasonable compromises. This paper explores mediated modeling as a group consensus building process for understanding relationships between ecological, economic and cultural well-being in the \{UMR\} floodplain. We describe a workshop structure used to engage \{UMR\} stakeholders that may be extended to resource use conflicts in other complex ecosystems. We provide recommendations for improving on these participatory methods in structuring future efforts. In conclusion, we suggest that tools which facilitate collaborative learning, such as mediated modeling, need to be incorporated at an institutional level as a vital element of integrated ecosystem management. },

@article{Watson2004245,
	Abstract = {A new software framework for environmental simulation modeling is described. The framework facilitates fast, powerful model development by providing a system for implementing separate model elements as autonomous modules, which may then be tightly and flexibility integrated. The system is object-oriented, with integration of modules achieved through the sharing of common objects. Module autonomy is achieved by the use of generic messages passed between modules through shared objects. Shared objects represent concepts such as data, time, or sub-models. This facilitates effective model integration with no loss of speed as a result of the integration process. A large existing collection of modules, including IO, data representation and visualization, allows new models to be developed quickly with minimal attention to repetitive tasks. To date, the applications of the framework have been in the domains of hydrological, wildlife and ecosystem modeling. Experience has shown that the persistent merits of the framework include the data sharing/message passing approach, the generic conceptualization of modeling objects, and the body of modules assembled to date. The disadvantages are proving to be the dependence on a specific language and compiler. This hinders the utility of the framework for the broader model development community. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Many of the best practices concerning the development of ecological models or analytic techniques published in the scientific literature are not fully available to modelers but rather are stored in scientists' digital or biological memories. We propose that it is time to address the problem of storing, documenting, and executing ecological models and analytical procedures. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to design and implement a web application that will help to meet this challenge. This tool will foster cooperation among scientists, enhancing the creation of relevant knowledge that could be transferred to environmental managers. We have implemented this conceptual framework in a tool called ModeleR. This is being used to document, share, and execute more than 200 models and analytical processes associated with a global change monitoring program that is being undertaken in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (south Spain). ModeleR uses the concept of scientific workflow to connect and execute different types of models and analytical processes. Finally, we have envisioned the creation of a federation of model repositories where models documented within a local repository could be linked and even executed by other researchers. },

It is necessary to understand whether Big Data is a radical shift or an incremental change for the existing digital infrastructures. This manuscript explores the impact of Big Data dimensionalities (commonly known as `V' axes: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, visualization) on the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and particularly its common digital infrastructure (i.e. the \{GEOSS\} Common Infrastructure). \{GEOSS\} is a global and flexible network of content providers allowing decision makers to access an extraordinary range of data and information. \{GEOSS\} is a pioneering framework for global and multidisciplinary data sharing in the \{EO\} realm. The manuscript introduces and discusses the general \{GEOSS\} strategies to address Big Data challenges, focusing on the cloud-based discovery and access solutions. A final section reports the results of the scalability and flexibility performance tests. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Fifteen water flow-dependent ecosystem services (ES) are modelled for the case of the Ter (Catalonia, Spain), a river with persisting intra- and inter-basin conflicts on water flows. The aim is to analyse \{ES\} response (and ensuing social reaction) to changes in water flow management, in a context of several tradeoffs and synergies driven by access to water use. We argue for a new modelling approach to integrate diverse values and perspectives through engaging with stakeholders' concerns and claims. This is done under different conditions, including droughts, wet years, and different options for managing flows. Our approach involves two stages, namely water allocation modelling, including scenario development, and \{ES\} provision modelling, including participatory design of service suitability curves. The method presented allows analysing spatial/temporal patterns and \{ES\} performance. The paper explains methodological innovation and its application to highlight the role of recurrent socio-environmental conflicts in water management decisions. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Abrupt systemic changes in ecological and socio-economic systems are a regular occurrence. While there has been much attention to studying systemic changes primarily in ecology as well as in economics, the attempts to do so for coupled socio-environmental systems are rarer. This paper bridges the gap by reviewing how models can be instrumental in exploring significant, fundamental changes in such systems. The history of modelling systemic change in various disciplines contains a range of definitions and approaches. Even so, most of these efforts share some common challenges within the modelling context. We propose a framework drawing these challenges together, and use it to discuss the articles in this thematic issue on modelling systemic change in coupled social and environmental systems. The differing approaches used highlight that modelling systemic change is an area of endeavour that would benefit from greater synergies between the various disciplines concerned with systemic change. },

@article{Kumar201377,
	Abstract = {Two commonly used strategies in modeling snowmelt are the energy balance and temperature-index methods. Here we evaluate the distributed hydrologic impacts of these two different snowmelt modeling strategies, each in conjunction with a physics-based hydrologic model (PIHM). Results illustrate that both the Isnobal energy-balance and calibrated temperature-index methods adequately reproduce snow depletion at the observation site. However, the models exhibit marked differences in the distribution of snowmelt. When combined with PIHM, both models capture streamflow reasonably during calibration year (WY06), but Isnobal model gives better streamflow results in the validation year (WY07). The uncalibrated temperature-index model predicts streamflow poorly in both years. Differences between distributed snowmelt, as predicted by Isnobal and calibrated temperature-index method, and its consequent effect on predicted hydrologic states suggest the need to carefully calibrate temperature-index models in both time and space. Combined physics-based snow and hydrologic models provide the best accuracy, while a temperature-index model using coefficients from the literature the poorest. },

It is widely used in engineering and geophysics fields to assess and predict the likelihood of various outcomes. This paper describes a UQ platform called UQ-PyL (Uncertainty Quantification Python Laboratory), a flexible software platform designed to quantify uncertainty of complex dynamical models. UQ-PyL integrates different kinds of UQ methods, including experimental design, statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling and parameter optimization. It is written in Python language and runs on all common operating systems. UQ-PyL has a graphical user interface that allows users to enter commands via pull-down menus. It is equipped with a model driver generator that allows any computer model to be linked with the software. We illustrate the different functions of UQ-PyL by applying it to the uncertainty analysis of the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model. We will also demonstrate that UQ-PyL can be applied to a wide range of applications. },

To address this need within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, we introduce the Great Lakes Dashboard (GLD), a dynamic web data visualization platform that brings multiple time series data sets together for visual analysis and download. The platform's adaptable, robust, and expandable Time Series Core Object Model (GLD-TSCOM) separates the growing complexity and size of Great Lakes data sets from the web application interface.

	Abstract = {Abstract Hydrologic models for a particular watershed or a region are created for addressing a specific research or management problem, and most of the models do not get reused after the project is completed. Similarly, multiple models may exist for a particular geographic location from different researchers or organizations. To avoid the duplication of efforts, and enable model reuse and enhancement through collaborative efforts, a prototype cyberinfrastructure, called SWATShare, is developed for sharing, execution and visualization of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The objective of this paper is to present the software architecture, functional capabilities and implementation of SWATShare as a collaborative environment for hydrology research and education using the models published and shared in the system. Besides the capability of publishing, sharing, discovery and downloading of SWAT models, some of the functions in SWATShare such as model calibration are supported by providing access to high performance computing resources including the XSEDE and cloud. Additionally, SWATShare can create dynamic spatial and temporal plots of model outputs at different scales. SWATShare can also be used as an educational tool within a classroom setting for comparing the hydrologic processes under different geographic and climatic settings. The utility of SWATShare for collaborative research and education is demonstrated by using three case studies. Even though this paper focuses on the SWAT model, the system's architecture can be replicated for other models as well. },
